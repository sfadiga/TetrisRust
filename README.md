# TetrisRust
A Tetris game implementation using Rust !

This implementation was inspired by OLC great video:

The only dep is crossterm for keyboard handling
The screen rendering logic is (sort of) OS agnostic, at least for Win/Linux

A possible future improvement is to use: https://github.com/octotep/bevy_crossterm/ for a better
player experience

Since I'm still learning Rust, I'm pretty sure that there are a ton of improvements to be made on the code.
If you spot something to correct or improve feel free to open an issue or to do a pr.
